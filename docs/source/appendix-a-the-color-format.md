Appendix A: The Color Format
============================

Colors are represented throughout the **dspreset** files using an 8-digit ARGB color format. These are identical to web color hex codes except with an additional 2-digit hex number in front of them. The first two digits are a hexadecimal representation of alpha level with 00 being fully transparent, 80 being 50% transparent, and FF being fully opaque. 

Examples:

- Black (solid): FF000000
- Black (90% transparency): E6000000
- Red (solid): FFFF0000
- Red (50% transparency): 80FF0000
- Blue (solid): FF0000FF
