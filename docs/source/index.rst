Welcome to the DecentSampler Developer Guide
============================================

**DecentSampler** is a free sampling plug-in that allows music composers to use multi-samples in the DecentSampler format. This document is a guide to creating samples in that format.

If you have no familiarity with the DecentSamples format, `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxPRmD_RNCY>`_ is a great place to start. After that, you'll want to start at the :doc:`introduction` to learn a bit more about how to create sample libraries.
