# Appendix B: The &lt;binding&gt; element

Adding a binding to a UI control, MIDI handler, or modulator tells the DecentSampler engine that it should take input from a source and use it to change values in another part of the engine. An example of this would be a knob which controls the volume of a group, a CC controller that changes an effect parameter, or an LFO that modulates an effect parameter.

In order to set up a binding for a specific source, create a `<binding>` element within the source element. 

In this example, a labeled knob is controlling the volume of the first group of samples (group 0): 

```xml
<DecentSampler>
  <ui>
    <tab>
      <labeled-knob x="420" y="100" label="RT" type="float" minValue="0" maxValue="1" value="0.3" textSize="20">
        <binding type="amp" level="group" position="0" parameter="AMP_VOLUME" translation="linear" translationOutputMin="0" translationOutputMax="1.0"  />
      </labeled-knob>
    </tab>
  </ui>
</DecentSampler>
```

Here's a full list of parameters for the `<binding>` element:

1. NOTE: The indexes of the parameter list also include UI controls that are not editable, such as `<label>` UI controls, so you'll want to account for that when calculating your positions. 

    Here's a quick example:

    If your UI's `<tab>` section has the following elements under it: `<label>`, `<control>`,`<label>`,`<control>`. The `position` indexes of the four elements will be 0, 1, 2, 3. Therefore, the indexes of the two `<control>` elements will be 1 and 3, respectively.

2. NOTE: If your sample library manipulates `start`, `end`, `loopStart`, or `loopEnd` after a sample library's initial load, the sample playback engine must be in RAM/Memory mode (not disk streaming) or you will get very unpredictable results. In order to enforce this, sample creators should use the `playbackEngine` attribute.

## Translation Modes

There are currently three binding translation modes: `linear`, `table`, `fixed_value`

### Mode #1: `linear`

**linear** mode allows values that come in to be scaled up or down before they get passed along to the binding's target. If you set your translation mode to `linear` you should also `translationOutputMin` and `translationOutputMax`.

Example usage:

```xml
<binding level="ui" type="control" position="0" parameter="value" translation="linear" 
               translationOutputMin="0" translationOutputMax="1"/>
```

### Mode #2: `table`

**table** mode allows you to transform the binding's input in a more complex fashion before it gets passed along to the binding's target. If you set your translation mode to `table` you must define the `translationTable` parameter as well. This consists of a series of input-output pairs, separated by semi-colons. 

### Mode #3: `fixed_value`

**fixed_value** mode allows you to completely disregard the input of a binding and instead always use a supplied value. In order to use this translation mode, you must also specify a `translationValue`. This can be very useful when trying to have menu options enable and disable groups. An example usage:

```xml
<binding type="general" level="group" position="1" parameter="ENABLED" translation="fixed_value" translationValue="true" />
```
